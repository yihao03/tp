# TutBook Developer Guide

TutBook helps tuition centre administrators **manage students, tutors, parents, and classes efficiently**.  
It combines the speed of a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** with the convenience of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, designed to streamline administrative tasks in a tuition centre.

This guide explains the **architecture, design decisions, implementation details, and testing strategy** behind TutBook. It also documents the rationale for major features, sequence diagrams, and proposed future enhancements.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**


<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `ClassListPanel`, `SessionListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person`, `TuitionClass`, and `ClassSession` objects residing in the `Model`.

**Key UI Panels:**
- `PersonListPanel` displays a list of persons (students, tutors, parents) using `PersonCard` components.
- `ClassListPanel` displays a list of tuition classes with their enrolled students and assigned tutors using `ClassCard` components.
- `SessionListPanel` displays a list of class sessions with their date, time, location, and attendance information using `SessionCard` components.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

**Additional concrete commands and parsers:**

- `ListSessionCommand`, `ListSessionCommandParser` (command word: `listsessions`)
- `ViewSessionCommand`, `ViewSessionCommandParser` (command word: `viewsession`)
- `ListStudentsCommand`, `ListStudentsCommandParser` (command word: `liststudents`)
- `UnjoinClassCommand`, `UnjoinClassCommandParser` (command word: `unjoin`)
- `JoinClassCommand`, `JoinClassCommandParser` (command word: `join`)
- `AddSessionCommand`, `AddSessionCommandParser` (command word: `addsession`)
- `DeleteSessionCommand`, `DeleteSessionCommandParser` (command word: `deletesession`)
- `AttendCommand`, `AttendCommandParser` (command word: `attend`)
- `ListClassCommand`, `ListClassCommandParser` (command word: `listclass`)
- `ListParentsCommand`, `ListParentsCommandParser` (command word: `parentsof`)
- `ListChildrenCommand`, `ListChildrenCommandParser` (command word: `childrenof`)
- `EditClassCommand`, `EditClassCommandParser` (command word: `editclass`)
- `DeleteClassCommand`, `DeleteClassCommandParser` (command word: `deleteclass`)
- `AddClassCommand`, `AddClassCommandParser` (command word: `addclass`)
- `LinkCommand`, `LinkCommandParser` (command word: `link`)


### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note on Name Uniqueness:** The `UniquePersonList` enforces that each person must have a unique name. This means two persons cannot have identical names, even if they have different roles (e.g., student vs parent). If your use case requires managing individuals with the same name, users should differentiate them using suffixes or indexing (e.g., "John Tan (Father)" and "John Tan (Son)", or "John Tan 1" and "John Tan 2").
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `TutBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `TutBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

**Extended domain model (new):**

> TutBook introduces `TuitionClass` (with `students`, `tutors`, `sessions`) and `ClassSession` (per-session `attendance`). Relationships are validated by roles (`STUDENT`, `TUTOR`, `PARENT`). Attendance is stored per session as a map from student to `AttendanceStatus`.

<img src="images/DomainModelExtended.png" width="650"/>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

**Extended JSON adapters (new):**

> Classes and sessions are serialized via `JsonAdaptedClass` and `JsonAdaptedSession`, with attendance encoded as a string map.

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramExtended.png" width="650"/>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Class Enrollment (join / unjoin)

**Join** validates that the person is a `STUDENT`, prevents duplicate enrollment, updates the class roster, and persists changes.  
![Join Sequence](images/JoinClassSequenceDiagram.png)

**Unjoin** removes a `STUDENT` or `TUTOR` from a class, with guardrails if not a member.  
![Unjoin Sequence](images/UnjoinClassSequenceDiagram.png)

---

### Remove From Class Feature

#### Implementation

The remove-from-class feature provides the inverse operation of the join command, allowing removal of students and tutors from classes.

**Key Components**
- `UnjoinClassCommand` - Handles removal logic  
- Enhanced `TuitionClass` with removal methods for students and tutors  
- Cascade cleanup when a person is deleted (removed from all classes)

**Operations**
- Removes student from class enrollment  
- Removes tutor from class assignment  
- Validates person role & class membership before removal

**Sequence diagrams**

- Join to Class  
  <img src="images/JoinClassSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

- Unjoin from Class  
  <img src="images/UnjoinClassSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

- Delete Class (cascade)  
  <img src="images/DeleteClassCascadeSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

---

### Session Management

**Add session** enforces unique `sessionName` per class and saves date/time/location.  
![Add Session](images/AddSessionSequenceDiagram.png)

**Mark attendance** validates student enrollment and updates per-session attendance.  
![Attend](images/AttendCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

**View session** aggregates meta and attendance summary for display.  
![View Session](images/ViewSessionSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Implementation

The session management feature allows users to create, view, and manage class sessions with attendance tracking.

**Core Classes**
- `ClassSession` – Represents a single session with date/time, location, and attendance records  
- `TuitionClass` – Enhanced to store a list of sessions  
- `AddSessionCommand`, `DeleteSessionCommand`, `ViewSessionCommand`, `ListSessionCommand`

**Storage Implementation**
- Sessions are persisted via `JsonAdaptedSession`  
- Attendance per session stored as `studentName → PRESENT/ABSENT`

**Key Operations**
1. Adding a Session  
2. Marking Attendance per session  
3. Viewing Session details with attendance records  
4. Listing sessions for a class  
5. Listing students for attendance view

**Sequence diagrams**

- Add Session  
  <img src="images/AddSessionSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

- Mark Attendance  
  <img src="images/AttendCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

- View Session  
  <img src="images/ViewSessionSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

**List sessions for a class**
- Command: `listsessions c/CLASS_NAME`  
- Updates observable session list  
- Shows count or `[No sessions]`

**List students in a class**
- Command: `liststudents c/CLASS_NAME`  
- Filters left panel to only show enrolled students  

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Session Storage Structure**

- **Chosen:** Store sessions within each class  
  - Pros: clear ownership, easy class-scoped management  
  - Cons: traverse class to find sessions  

- **Alternative:** Standalone session store  
  - Pros: direct session access  
  - Cons: risk of orphan sessions, complexity

---

### Parent–Child Linking

Links are bidirectional and role-validated (`PARENT` ↔ `STUDENT`), with idempotency for already-linked pairs.  
![Link](images/LinkParentChildSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Parent Management Feature

Lists parents of a specific child.

**Key Components**
- `ListParentsCommand`  
- Model filtering for parent lookups

**Command format**
```
parentsof n/CHILD_NAME
```

#### Children Management Feature

Lists children of a specific parent.

**Key Components**
- `ListChildrenCommand`  
- Model filtering for child lookups

**Command format**
```
childrenof n/PARENT_NAME
```

---

### Deleting a Class

Deleting a class removes enrollments, unassigns tutors, and clears sessions before persisting.  
![Delete Class Cascade](images/DeleteClassCascadeSequenceDiagram.png)

---

### Storage Extensions

Classes/sessions are serialized via `JsonAdaptedClass` and `JsonAdaptedSession`; attendance is a string map (`name → PRESENT/ABSENT`).  
![Storage Extended](images/StorageClassDiagramExtended.png)

---

### Enhanced Class Storage

#### Implementation

Classes now store comprehensive details including sessions and maintain persistent state across application restarts.

**Storage Enhancements**
- Classes store list of sessions and attendance records  
- Session metadata (date, time, location) preserved  
- Attendance history per student persisted

**JSON Structure**

```json
{
  "className": "Math101",
  "tutors": ["Ms. Lim"],
  "students": ["John Doe", "Jane Smith"],
  "sessions": [
    {
      "sessionName": "Week 1 Tutorial",
      "dateTime": "2024-03-15T14:30:00",
      "location": "COM1-B103",
      "attendanceRecords": {
        "John Doe": "PRESENT",
        "Jane Smith": "ABSENT"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures all class-related data is cohesively stored and fully restored on app restart.

---

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

- Tuition centre administrators and managers
- has a need to manage a significant number of contacts (students, tutors, parents)
- needs to track relationships between different contact types
- manages class schedules and student-tutor assignments
- handles administrative tasks like attendance tracking and fee management
- prefer desktop apps over other types
- can type fast
- prefers typing to mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
- values efficiency and comprehensive information access

**Value proposition**: Streamline tuition centre management by providing a centralized system to manage contacts, track relationships between students, tutors and parents, and access all critical information at a glance - all through an efficient CLI interface that's faster than traditional GUI applications

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Overall difficulty
Compared to AB3, which manages a single entity (`Person`), TutBook introduces five inter-linked entities — `Student`, `Tutor`, `Parent`, `TuitionClass`, and `ClassSession` — each with its own constraints and bidirectional links. This raised design and testing complexity significantly.

### Technical challenges

| Area | Challenge | Resolution |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Model | Maintaining referential integrity when deleting classes or contacts | Implemented cascade cleanup in `ModelManager`. |
| Storage | Serialising nested objects (Class → Session → Attendance) | Created `JsonAdaptedClass` and `JsonAdaptedSession`. |
| Logic | Avoiding duplication across commands | Introduced `ClassCommandUtil` helper. |
| Parser | Supporting many prefixes (`c/`, `s/`, `status/`) | Extended `ArgumentTokenizer` to nested prefix structure. |
| Testing | Creating realistic linked test data | Added `TypicalClasses` and `TypicalSessions` fixtures. |

### Team effort
- 5 developers over 9 weeks, ~30 commits each.  
- ≈ 70 % of AB3 refactored or re-engineered.  
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Codecov for every PR.

### Code reuse and efficiency
- ~15 % of AB3 code reused (core parser/UI logic).  

### Achievements
- Delivered full multi-role contact management and session tracking.  
- Achieved > 80 % coverage in `logic`; > 80 % overall.  
- Extended DG/UG with new diagrams and testing sections.  
- Maintained consistent code style, peer reviews, and iteration deadlines.
