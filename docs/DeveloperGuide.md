# TutBook Developer Guide

TutBook helps tuition centre administrators **manage students, tutors, parents, and classes efficiently**.  
It combines the speed of a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** with the convenience of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, designed to streamline administrative tasks in a tuition centre.

This guide explains the **architecture, design decisions, implementation details, and testing strategy** behind TutBook. It also documents the rationale for major features, sequence diagrams, and proposed future enhancements.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**


<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

**Additional concrete commands and parsers:**

- `ListSessionCommand`, `ListSessionCommandParser` (command word: `listsessions`)
- `ViewSessionCommand`, `ViewSessionCommandParser` (command word: `viewsession`)
- `ListStudentsCommand`, `ListStudentsCommandParser` (command word: `liststudents`)
- `UnjoinClassCommand`, `UnjoinClassCommandParser` (command word: `unjoin`)
- `JoinClassCommand`, `JoinClassCommandParser` (command word: `join`)
- `AddSessionCommand`, `AddSessionCommandParser` (command word: `addsession`)
- `DeleteSessionCommand`, `DeleteSessionCommandParser` (command word: `deletesession`)
- `AttendCommand`, `AttendCommandParser` (command word: `attend`)
- `ListClassCommand`, `ListClassCommandParser` (command word: `listclass`)
- `ListParentsCommand`, `ListParentsCommandParser` (command word: `parentsof`)
- `ListChildrenCommand`, `ListChildrenCommandParser` (command word: `childrenof`)
- `EditClassCommand`, `EditClassCommandParser` (command word: `editclass`)
- `DeleteClassCommand`, `DeleteClassCommandParser` (command word: `deleteclass`)
- `AddClassCommand`, `AddClassCommandParser` (command word: `addclass`)
- `LinkCommand`, `LinkCommandParser` (command word: `link`)


### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `TutBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `TutBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

**Extended domain model (new):**

> TutBook introduces `TuitionClass` (with `students`, `tutors`, `sessions`) and `ClassSession` (per-session `attendance`). Relationships are validated by roles (`STUDENT`, `TUTOR`, `PARENT`). Attendance is stored per session as a map from student to `AttendanceStatus`.

<img src="images/DomainModelExtended.png" width="650"/>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

**Extended JSON adapters (new):**

> Classes and sessions are serialized via `JsonAdaptedClass` and `JsonAdaptedSession`, with attendance encoded as a string map.

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramExtended.png" width="650"/>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

---

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

---

### Class Enrollment (join / unjoin)

**Join** validates that the person is a `STUDENT`, prevents duplicate enrollment, updates the class roster, and persists changes.  
![Join Sequence](images/JoinClassSequenceDiagram.png)

**Unjoin** removes a `STUDENT` or `TUTOR` from a class, with guardrails if not a member.  
![Unjoin Sequence](images/UnjoinClassSequenceDiagram.png)

---

### Remove From Class Feature

#### Implementation

The remove-from-class feature provides the inverse operation of the join command, allowing removal of students and tutors from classes.

**Key Components**
- `UnjoinClassCommand` - Handles removal logic  
- Enhanced `TuitionClass` with removal methods for students and tutors  
- Cascade cleanup when a person is deleted (removed from all classes)

**Operations**
- Removes student from class enrollment  
- Removes tutor from class assignment  
- Validates person role & class membership before removal

**Sequence diagrams**

- Join to Class  
  <img src="images/JoinClassSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

- Unjoin from Class  
  <img src="images/UnjoinClassSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

- Delete Class (cascade)  
  <img src="images/DeleteClassCascadeSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

---

### Session Management

**Add session** enforces unique `sessionName` per class and saves date/time/location.  
![Add Session](images/AddSessionSequenceDiagram.png)

**Mark attendance** validates student enrollment and updates per-session attendance.  
![Attend](images/AttendCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

**View session** aggregates meta and attendance summary for display.  
![View Session](images/ViewSessionSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Implementation

The session management feature allows users to create, view, and manage class sessions with attendance tracking.

**Core Classes**
- `ClassSession` – Represents a single session with date/time, location, and attendance records  
- `TuitionClass` – Enhanced to store a list of sessions  
- `AddSessionCommand`, `DeleteSessionCommand`, `ViewSessionCommand`, `ListSessionCommand`

**Storage Implementation**
- Sessions are persisted via `JsonAdaptedSession`  
- Attendance per session stored as `studentName → PRESENT/ABSENT`

**Key Operations**
1. Adding a Session  
2. Marking Attendance per session  
3. Viewing Session details with attendance records  
4. Listing sessions for a class  
5. Listing students for attendance view

**Sequence diagrams**

- Add Session  
  <img src="images/AddSessionSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

- Mark Attendance  
  <img src="images/AttendCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

- View Session  
  <img src="images/ViewSessionSequenceDiagram.png" width="650"/>

**List sessions for a class**
- Command: `listsessions c/CLASS_NAME`  
- Updates observable session list  
- Shows count or `[No sessions]`

**List students in a class**
- Command: `liststudents c/CLASS_NAME`  
- Filters left panel to only show enrolled students  

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Session Storage Structure**

- **Chosen:** Store sessions within each class  
  - Pros: clear ownership, easy class-scoped management  
  - Cons: traverse class to find sessions  

- **Alternative:** Standalone session store  
  - Pros: direct session access  
  - Cons: risk of orphan sessions, complexity

---

### Parent–Child Linking

Links are bidirectional and role-validated (`PARENT` ↔ `STUDENT`), with idempotency for already-linked pairs.  
![Link](images/LinkParentChildSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Parent Management Feature

Lists parents of a specific child.

**Key Components**
- `ListParentsCommand`  
- Model filtering for parent lookups

**Command format**
parentsof n/CHILD_NAME

markdown
Copy code

#### Children Management Feature

Lists children of a specific parent.

**Key Components**
- `ListChildrenCommand`  
- Model filtering for child lookups

**Command format**

### Deleting a Class (cascade cleanup)

Deleting a class removes enrollments, unassigns tutors, and clears sessions before persisting.  
![Delete Class Cascade](images/DeleteClassCascadeSequenceDiagram.png)

---

### Storage Extensions

Classes/sessions are serialized via `JsonAdaptedClass` and `JsonAdaptedSession`; attendance is a string map (`name → PRESENT/ABSENT`).  
![Storage Extended](images/StorageClassDiagramExtended.png)

---

### Enhanced Class Storage

#### Implementation

Classes now store comprehensive details including sessions and maintain persistent state across application restarts.

**Storage Enhancements**
- Classes store list of sessions and attendance records  
- Session metadata (date, time, location) preserved  
- Attendance history per student persisted

**JSON Structure**

```json
{
  "className": "Math101",
  "tutors": ["Ms. Lim"],
  "students": ["John Doe", "Jane Smith"],
  "sessions": [
    {
      "sessionName": "Week 1 Tutorial",
      "dateTime": "2024-03-15T14:30:00",
      "location": "COM1-B103",
      "attendanceRecords": {
        "John Doe": "PRESENT",
        "Jane Smith": "ABSENT"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures all class-related data is cohesively stored and fully restored on app restart.

---

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

- Tuition centre administrators and managers
- has a need to manage a significant number of contacts (students, tutors, parents)
- needs to track relationships between different contact types
- manages class schedules and student-tutor assignments
- handles administrative tasks like attendance tracking and fee management
- prefer desktop apps over other types
- can type fast
- prefers typing to mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
- values efficiency and comprehensive information access

**Value proposition**: Streamline tuition centre management by providing a centralized system to manage contacts, track relationships between students, tutors and parents, and access all critical information at a glance - all through an efficient CLI interface that's faster than traditional GUI applications

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

| # | Enhancement | Current Limitation | Proposed Fix | Impact |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | More specific error for invalid roles in `link` | Generic error message | Add role-based feedback ("Only a PARENT can link to a STUDENT") | Improved UX |
| 2 | Alphabetical sorting of classes | Unordered list output | Add `Comparator` in `Model#updateFilteredClassList()` | Better readability |
| 3 | Allow multiple tutors per class | One tutor only | Change `TuitionClass` → `List<Tutor>` | Realistic multi-tutor support |
| 4 | Edit session details (date/time) | Not editable | Add `editsession` command | Flexibility |
| 5 | Filter attendance by status | Always shows all | Add `status/` parameter in `viewsession` | Faster lookup |
| 6 | Display children in `listparents` | Not shown | Enhance `ListParentsCommand#format()` | Clearer relationships |
| 7 | Implement `archive` / `restorearchive` commands | No data versioning | Use `ArchiveManager` | Data safety |

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Overall difficulty
Compared to AB3, which manages a single entity (`Person`), TutBook introduces five inter-linked entities — `Student`, `Tutor`, `Parent`, `TuitionClass`, and `ClassSession` — each with its own constraints and bidirectional links. This raised design and testing complexity significantly.

### Technical challenges

| Area | Challenge | Resolution |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Model | Maintaining referential integrity when deleting classes or contacts | Implemented cascade cleanup in `ModelManager`. |
| Storage | Serialising nested objects (Class → Session → Attendance) | Created `JsonAdaptedClass` and `JsonAdaptedSession`. |
| Logic | Avoiding duplication across commands | Introduced `ClassCommandUtil` helper. |
| Parser | Supporting many prefixes (`c/`, `s/`, `status/`) | Extended `ArgumentTokenizer` to nested prefix structure. |
| Testing | Creating realistic linked test data | Added `TypicalClasses` and `TypicalSessions` fixtures. |

### Team effort
- 5 developers over 9 weeks, ~30 commits each.  
- ≈ 70 % of AB3 refactored or re-engineered.  
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Codecov for every PR.

### Code reuse and efficiency
- ~15 % of AB3 code reused (core parser/UI logic).  

### Achievements
- Delivered full multi-role contact management and session tracking.  
- Achieved > 80 % coverage in `logic`; > 80 % overall.  
- Extended DG/UG with new diagrams and testing sections.  
- Maintained consistent code style, peer reviews, and iteration deadlines.
