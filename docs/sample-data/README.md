## Resetting Data

To start fresh after using seed data:
```bash
rm data/addressbook.json
```

TutBook will create a new empty address book on next launch.

## Creating Your Own Seed Data

See the JSON schema in `src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/` for the correct format. Key points:

1. **Persons array**: Each person must have `name`, `phone`, `email`, `address`, `role` (STUDENT/TUTOR/PARENT), and `tags` array
2. **Classes array**: Each class must have `name`, optional `tutor` object, `students` array, and `sessions` array
3. **Sessions**: Each session needs `sessionName`, `dateTime` (ISO format), and `location`

The storage layer automatically handles bidirectional relationships between persons and classes.
